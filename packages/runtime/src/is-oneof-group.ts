/**
 * Is the given value a valid oneof group?
 *
 * We represent protobuf `oneof` as algebraic data types (ADT) in generated
 * code. But when working with messages of unknown type, the ADT does not
 * help us.
 *
 * This type guard checks if the given object adheres to the ADT rules, which
 * are as follows:
 *
 * 1) Must be an object.
 *
 * 2) Must have a "oneofKind" discriminator property.
 *
 * 3) If "oneofKind" is `undefined`, no member field is selected. The object
 * must not have any other properties.
 *
 * 4) If "oneofKind" is a `string`, the member field with this name is
 * selected.
 *
 * 5) If a member field is selected, the object must have a second property
 * with this name. The property must not be `undefined`.
 *
 * 6) No extra properties are allowed. The object has either one property
 * (no selection) or two properties (selection).
